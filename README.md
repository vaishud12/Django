Database:

Django supports multiple databases, including SQLite (default), PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle. You can choose the one that best fits your project requirements.
PostgreSQL is often preferred for production environments due to its scalability and robust features.
Define your database configuration in the Django settings file (settings.py) including the database engine, name, user, password, host, and port.
Database Viewer:

While developing and debugging your Django project, you can use various database viewers to inspect the data in your database tables.
Popular database viewers include pgAdmin for PostgreSQL, MySQL Workbench for MySQL, and DBeaver which supports multiple databases.
Use these tools to execute SQL queries, view table structures, and analyze data stored in your database.
APIs:

Django REST Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
Define serializers to specify the representation of Django model instances as JSON or XML.
Create views using DRF's APIView or ViewSet classes to handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different API endpoints.
Configure URL patterns to map API endpoints to views.
DRF provides authentication and permission classes for securing your APIs.
You can also implement custom authentication mechanisms and permission logic if needed.
Testing APIs with Postman:

Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs, allowing you to send HTTP requests and inspect the responses.
Define collections in Postman to organize your API requests.
Create requests for different API endpoints, specifying the HTTP method, URL, request headers, parameters, and request body (for POST and PUT requests).
Execute requests and examine the response status code, headers, and body.
Postman provides features for writing tests to automate API testing, including assertions on response data.
Use Postman's environment variables to manage different configurations for testing environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
Authentication and Authorization:

If your APIs require authentication, you can obtain authentication tokens (e.g., JWT tokens) using Postman and include them in your requests.
Test API endpoints that require authentication to ensure proper authorization checks are implemented.
Use Postman's request history and response viewer to track API interactions and debug issues.
By utilizing these tools and techniques, you can effectively manage your Django project's database, develop robust APIs, and test them thoroughly using Postman. This approach ensures that your e-commerce project is reliable, secure, and performs as expected.
